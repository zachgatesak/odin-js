Talking Points
	1. Story leading up to this point:
	2. Character of Nehemiah
	3. Challenges they've faced up to this point
	4. Main thrust of the book up to this point.
	5. Be careful with genealogies & the beauty of Verse-by-verse.
		Titus 3:8 
			The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people. 9But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. 10As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him, 11knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.
	6. We get to relearn the roles and needs of this people group as they themselves are going to relearn it.
	7. What is the purpose of Israel?
		Abrahamic Cov:
			Gen 12:1  Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. Gen 12:2  And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. Gen 12:3  I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed." 
		Mosaic Cov:
			Exo 19:5  Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; 	Exo 19:6  and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel." Exo 19:7  So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him. Exo 19:8  All the people answered together and said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do." And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD. 

	### Start Chapter 7 
	5. Neh 7:5  Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles and the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found written in it: 
		a. Numbering
			i. Can be bad : 2 Samuel 24:10 > David numbering his troops, 
			ii. Examples of it being good. > Numbers 1:1-46; 26:1-62 Moses having a number of fighting men, and temple dues.
		b. Why are genealogies important?
			i. certificate of church-membership for each Israelite.
			ii. contained the claims to official dignity that belonged to priest and Levite.
			iii.  Calls back to the convenents with Abraham Isaac and Jacob.
			iv. Testimony of the faithful remnant (compare 2 Sam24:10 to Neh 7:67
			v. You don't take genealogy if you do not think your civilization is going to make it.
			vi. emphasis is on the people of God not the location.
			vii. In this re-establishment of God's people, having a role call as well as being able to see their names signed on the covenenant (Neh 10:14)
			
	## Start genealogy
	a. Came down with Zerubbabel... (N 7:7, E2:2)
		i. Prominent men:
			1. Zerubbabel from Ezra
			2. Jeshua the high Priest (Ez 3:2)
		ii. Interesting how God uses twelve leaders toward the return of the people. Much like the twelve tribes. However one of these men ( Note Sheshbazzar is ommitted in EZ)
		iii. Sometimes we get different forms of the same name for example:
			Nehemiah 11:11  Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the leader of the house of God,
			1 Chronicles 9:11 Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the chief officer of the house of God;
	b. Sons (N 7:8-38 E2:3-35)
		i. The number of the men of the people of Israel: 
			a. Ezr 1:3  Whoever is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel--he is the God who is in Jerusalem. 
			b. Ezr 1:5  Then rose up the heads of the fathers' houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, everyone whose spirit God had stirred to go up to rebuild the house of the LORD that is in Jerusalem. 
		ii. Parosh: 7:8
			a. A further group of the sons of Parosh arrived under Ezra in 458 BC (Ezra 8:3)
			b. A few of the sons of Parosh were among those who took idolatrous foreign wives (Ezra 10:25)
			c. They seemingly assisted in the building of the walls of Jerusalem (Nehemiah 3:25)
			d. One of their number was among those who signed Nehemiah’s covenant as one of the chiefs of the people (Nehemiah 10:1; Nehemiah 10:14)
		iii. Men of Kiriath-jearim 7:29
	c. <priests> (N 7:39-42, E2:36-39)
		## Priests -- Their duties were manifold ( Exodus 27:20 Exodus 27:21 ; 29:38-44 ; Leviticus 6:12 ; 10:11 ; 24:8 ; Numbers 10:1-10 ; Deuteronomy 17:8-13 ; 33:10 ; Malachi 2:7 ). They represented the people before God, and offered the various sacrifices prescribed in the law.
		(NT)Heb 4: 14 Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
		(OT-NT)Heb 10:11  And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. Heb 10:12  But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, 
		NT we are called priests (1PE 2:9 that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.) 
		i. 4 courses of the 24 in 1 chron 24:1-19
		ii. Large % of these guys returned to Jerusalem
	d. Levites Singers Gatekeepers and Temple servants(N 7:43-45, E2:40-42)
		## Levites --
			Exo 32:26  then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, "Who is on the LORD's side? Come to me." And all the sons of Levi gathered around him. And he said to them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Put your sword on your side each of you, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill his brother and his companion and his neighbor.'" And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And that day about three thousand men of the people fell. 
			
			Num 3: 5And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 6“Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him. 7They shall keep guard over him and over the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, as they minister at the tabernacle. 8They shall guard all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and keep guard over the people of Israel as they minister at the tabernacle. 9And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the people of Israel. 10And you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall guard their priesthood. But if any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death.” ... They shall be mine: I am the LORD.”

			In Neh: 
				8:7-8 some were teachers of the law
				9:4-5, 12:8-9, 12:27-47 Lead the praise sessions
		i. only 74 returned
		ii. Judging by Neh 13:10 its possible the singers were also Levites.
		## singers
		iii. The singers were a special order of Levites, to 1 Chronicles 6:31-32 had been responsible for leading the singing and musical accompaniment in Tabernacle and Temple worship.
		iv. The sons of Asaph apear in a few other locations
			1. in Nehemiah 11:22-23 we learn of ‘the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the house of God’, and they were seen as so important that ‘the king’ (Artaxerxes) gave commandment concerning them,
		## Gatekeepers
		v. The Gatekeepers were another special order of Levites. In 1 Chronicles 9:17
		vi. The gatekeepers were responsible for opening the Temple doors each morning; watching over the chambers and treasuries; having charge of the vessels of service; and having responsibility for the furniture, the vessels of the sanctuary, the fine flour and wine and oil, and the frankincense and spices (1 Chronicles 9:26-30).
		## Temple servants
		vii. The Nethinim > (given ones) The Nethinim (given ones) probably had their initial origin in the Gibeonites who were forced to become ‘hewers of wood and drawers of water’ for the Tabernacle (Joshua 9:27). Whoever they were they were seen as ‘given to God’.
		viii. the Nethinim took the oath connected with the sure covenant of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 10:28-31).
	e. Solomon's servants (N7:46-60 , E2:43-58)
		i. We have no mean of knowing how, or whether, their duties differed from those of the Nethinim. They are probably included in the exemption from taxes of Ezra 7:24
		
	f. Could not prove descent (N7:61-64, E2:59-62) (Proselytes of Israel)
		i. (61-62 Proselytes of Israel) (Exodus 12:48). Indeed the fact that they are listed demonstrates their acceptability to the other immigrants already listed, but it is noteworthy that their names do not occur later in Ezra/Nehemiah. They were not called on to seal the covenant, or to supervise the building of the wall in Jerusalem, and so on.
		ii. (63-65 Proselytes of Priests)  Far more important was the situation of the priests who could not demonstrate their ancestry, for this excluded them from priestly office, and from reception of priestly benefits such as the tithe, and the parts of offerings and sacrifices particular to the priests. They would also presumably be liable to pay taxes. The exclusion was necessary because for a non-Aaronide to participate in the priesthood would have been seen as a major sacrilege (compare Numbers 16). The risk could not be taken.
	g. Governor's Response (N7:65, EE2:63)
		i. The Tirshatha was clearly in control of matters, and it was his decision, not to exclude them for ever, but to exclude them from eating of the priest’s portions until their position could be determined by the use of the Urim and Thummim, utilised by ‘a (High) Priest’.
		ii. Urim and the Thummim:
			1. High Priest’s breastpouch (Exodus 28:30; Leviticus 8:8; see also Deuteronomy 33:8-10; Numbers 27:21). These would appear to have given the answers of ‘yes’ or ‘no answer’ (no example is known of a specific ‘no’ being given as an answer). See for example 1 Samuel 14:41; 1 Samuel 23:9-12; 1 Samuel 28:6;
			2. Ezra 2 it would appear that the Tirshatha in question was Zerubbabel (or possibly Sheshbazzar if the decision was made very early on). We can compare the fact that the Tirshatha appears to have been able to decide the use of the Urim and Thummim with the fact that Joshua could do the same through the High Priest (Numbers 27:18-21).
			3. Regardless: "However, it should be noted that 1 Samuel 28:6 makes clear a definite answer was not always obtainable, so it may not have been as simple as tossing two stones on ground. Moses never used them; they were given for the high priest in aiding those who could not find God’s guidance any other way."
			4. Never mentioned again after this point.
	h. Counts (N7:66-69, E2:64-66)
	i. Offerings (N7:70-72, E2:68-69)
		a. In ez we have all the gifts compressed, and in Neh we actually see the splitting up of the offerings. Perhaps because in Ezra the governor did not want his contribution to be known. Its also advocated that this changes the focus to current day Neh, but this is unlikely due to the summation statement at the end.
	j. People were in their towns > People gather (N Book of the law, E Build the altar)
		a. So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their towns. And when the seventh month had come, the people of Israel were in their towns. 
		
Applications & Themes:
	Inerrency of Scripture:
		WIERSBE:
			"This section parallels Ezra 2:1-64. If you compare the two lists, you will see that some of Nehemiah's names and numbers differ from those recorded nearly a century before when the exiles returned from Babylon. This does not suggest that there are errors or contradictions in the Bible. Errors in spelling names or copying numbers could easily creep in over a century, and none of these differences affects any matter of doctrine or duty.
			Furthermore, the scribes who kept the public records certainly updated them after the community was established in Jerusalem. Ezra 2 lists the names of those who set out with Ezra, but it's possible that others joined the group after Zerubbabel'sx list was completed... Reading this long list of difficult names might be boring to the modern student, but these people were God's "bridge" from the defeats of the past to the hopes of the future. These Jews were the "living link" that connected the historic past with the prohpetic future and made it possible for Jesus Christ to come into the world. Ezra 2 and Hehemiah 7 are to the Old Testament what Hebrews 11 is to the Net Testament: a listing of the people whose faith and courage made things happen."
