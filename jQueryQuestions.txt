1. What is a selector?
  1.1 A selector allows you to grab an item from the dom and create an object. Once the JS object exists we can perform changes on the object as needed.

2. What does the $ symbol mean?
  2.1 It is a function that Jquery provides. Note that it is equivalent to jQuery();

3. Why is it often important to wait for the Document (DOM) to finish loading?
  3.1 Because the purpose of jquery is to manipulate items within the DOM, if we execute our code before the page has finished loading we may get unpredictable results.

4. How can you select a particular element on the page?
  4.1 $(function(){
      var li = $( 'li' );
  });
  4.2. Note that you can use css selectors to with the above context to select items.

5. How can you select only the <li> elements inside of <div> elements with class test-div?
  5.1 $(function(){
      var selection = $('div li.test-div');
  })

6. How are selectors actually pretty similar to the way CSS operates?
  6.1. See answer to 5.1

7. What does a jQuery selector return?
  7.1 A javascript object containing all DOM elements that match the jquery.

8. How can you manipulate the values (e.g. html, width, height...) of a selected element or elements?
  8.1 $( 'li' ).html( 'New HTML' );
  8.2
    $( 'li' ).html(function( index, oldHtml ) {
      return oldHtml + '!!!'
      });
  8.3
    $( 'li' ).each(function( index, elem ) {
    // this: the current, raw DOM element
    // index: the current element's index in the selection
    // elem: the current, raw DOM element (same as this)
    $( elem ).prepend( '<b>' + index + ': </b>' );
    });


9. What does it mean that selected elements are "implicitly iterated over"? (Think if you used $("div") what would happen)
  9.1 Jquery can select many elements from the Dom at one time. When many of these elements are included in the jquery object
    using methods such as .html will perform the method on all tags grabbed by the selector.

10. How can you create new elements?
  10.1 $( '<p>' ); // creates a new <p> element with no content
  10.2 $( '<p>Hello!</p>' ); // creates a new <p> element with content
  10.3 $( '<p class="greet">Hello!</p>' ); // creates a new <p> with content and class
  10.4
    $( '<p>', {
      html: 'Hello!',
      'class': 'greet'
    });
  10.5
    function appendText() {
      var txt1 = "<p>Text.</p>";               // Create element with HTML
      var txt2 = $("<p></p>").text("Text.");   // Create with jQuery
      var txt3 = document.createElement("p");  // Create with DOM
      txt3.innerHTML = "Text.";
      $("body").append(txt1, txt2, txt3);      // Append the new elements
    }
  10.6
    $("img").after("Some text after");
    $("img").before("Some text before");

11. How can you insert new elements into the DOM?
  11.1 append() - Inserts content at the end of the selected elements
  11.2 prepend() - Inserts content at the beginning of the selected elements
  11.3 after() - Inserts content after the selected elements
  11.4 before() - Inserts content before the selected elements

12. How can you chain jQuery selectors?
  12.1 One of the most lucrative parts of jQuery is the ability to "chain" methods together.
    This means that we can call a series of methods on a selection without having to repeat the selection or store
    the selection in a variable. We can even make new selections based on previous selections, all without breaking the chain.

13. What happens to the elements you've already selected (e.g. with $("li")) if another qualifying element (e.g. a <li>gets added to the DOM later?
  13.1 any methods prior to that function will affect all selected li's however any actions done after the further
    specificaiton will not affect the earlier elements.

14. What does "traversing the DOM" mean?
  14.1 Generally grabbing items from the Dom by hitting the parent and navigating using tools like parentOf and childOf etc.

15. How can you add CSS to a selected element?
  15.1 The preferred method would be to have the css already setup and just simply use the jquery's .addClass(class) to the desired element.
  15.2 alternatively you can use jquery to manually add css like the following:
        var body_tag_css = {
       "background-color": "#ddd",
       "font-weight": "",
       "color": "#000"
      }
      //Apply your CSS to the body tag.  You can enter any tag here, as
      //well as ID's and Classes.
      $("body").css(body_tag_css);

16. How do you add or remove data attributes from an element?
  16.1 .data() > can be used to add information to jquery object
  16.2 .removeData() > can be used to delete those data objects.

17. What new iterators (including some familiar Ruby ones) does jQuery give you?
  17.1 .each() uses the .length property to iterate over all properties of the jquery object
    $.each([ 52, 97 ], function( index, value ) {
      alert( index + ": " + value );
    });
  17.2
  function listIterate(){
    return $('li').map(function(item, index){
      return item.innerHTML;
      });
    }

18. How would you add the class some-class to every <li> on the page?
  18.1 $('li').addClass('some-class');

19. How would you use #map to return an array listing the contents of a particular list?
  19.1 $('li').map(function(){
    return this.innerHTML;
  })

20. How is jQuery's #map almost identical to Ruby's?

21. Where can you look up any selectors you need?
  21.1 https://api.jquery.com
