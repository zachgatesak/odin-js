1. What is a selector?
  1.1 A selector allows you to grab an item from the dom and create an object. Once the JS object exists we can perform changes on the object as needed.

2. What does the $ symbol mean?
  2.1 It is a function that Jquery provides. Note that it is equivalent to jQuery();

3. Why is it often important to wait for the Document (DOM) to finish loading?
  3.1 Because the purpose of jquery is to manipulate items within the DOM, if we execute our code before the page has finished loading we may get unpredictable results.

4. How can you select a particular element on the page?
  4.1 $(function(){
      var li = $( 'li' );
  });
  4.2. Note that you can use css selectors to with the above context to select items.

5. How can you select only the <li> elements inside of <div> elements with class test-div?
5.1 $(function(){
    var selection = $('div li.test-div');
})

6. How are selectors actually pretty similar to the way CSS operates?
6.1. See answer to 5.1

7. What does a jQuery selector return?
7.1 A javascript object containing all DOM elements that match the jquery.

8. How can you manipulate the values (e.g. html, width, height...) of a selected element or elements?
9. What does it mean that selected elements are "implicitly iterated over"? (Think if you used $("div") what would happen)
10. How can you create new elements?
11. How can you insert new elements into the DOM?
12. How can you chain jQuery selectors?
13. What happens to the elements you've already selected (e.g. with $("li")) if another qualifying element (e.g. a <li>gets added to the DOM later?
14. What does "traversing the DOM" mean?
15. How can you add CSS to a selected element?
16. How do you add or remove data attributes from an element?
17. What new iterators (including some familiar Ruby ones) does jQuery give you?
18. How would you add the class some-class to every <li> on the page?
19. How would you use #map to return an array listing the contents of a particular list?
20. How is jQuery's #map almost identical to Ruby's?
21. Where can you look up any selectors you need?
